# Eazy4D

This is a collection of (lightweight) tools for 4DV research. (**WIP**)

Currently it's only a personal utility library, and it's frequently updated.

Any suggestions and bug reports are welcome through GitHub Issues. But PRs for new features are less likely to be accepted.

**Please cite the source if you want to use code pieces in this library.**
